# The Movie App

Work in progress ðŸ”§

## About this project

This is the last project of the [ADA ITW](https://adaitw.org/) Frontend Development Bootcamp. It is a movie search engine based on the [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) (The Movie Data Base) API.

I will add more details to the readme as soon as I finish the project.

In the meantime, if you want to see some of the projects I've created before, you can visit my [portfolio website](https://candelaolha.netlify.app/).

Stay tunned! ðŸ¤—
